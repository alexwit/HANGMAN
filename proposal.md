# HANGMAN Xtreme - Alex Wittebrood 10288880

Hangman Xtreme is a game app where the user need's to guess a certain word of a certain length within a certain amount of trys.
The difference between the Hangman Xtreme app and the original Hangman game is that you can make the game more difficult by 
letting the computer change the word to another word of the same length ingame. But it is also possible to play the game
with the original gameplay you remember from when you were waiting in a restaurant as a kid. 

Features:

-ingame letter showing
-easy activation of Xtreme / Evil mode
-possibility to length of a word
-Highscore to compete with your friends
